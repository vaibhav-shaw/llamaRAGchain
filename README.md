# Langchain Retriever and Chain

## Overview

This project implements a **Retriever** and **Chain** using Langchain, allowing efficient information retrieval and chain-building for advanced text generation tasks. Langchain helps with chaining together various components for building powerful applications with LLMs.

## Features

- **Retriever**: Efficiently pulls relevant information from a large dataset based on user queries.
- **Chain**: A series of operations that handle user inputs and guide them through different stages of processing.
- **Langchain Integration**: Harness the power of Langchain to manage workflows and organize language model operations.
  
## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Langchain
- OpenAI (for Llama 3.1 API)
